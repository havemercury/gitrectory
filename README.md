# gitrectory

[Gitrectory](https://gitrectory.netlify.com) is a React app that looks through users on GitHub.

This app was written primarily with React and pulls information from GitHub's API. Because there was so much data that had to be pulled up through components. Context was used so that there was a more general area to store different the information.

Gitrectory bounces off of Brad Traversy's [GitHub Finder](https://githubfinderoriginal.netlify.com/) app. This was my first introduction to React and giving the UI a retouch was a way for me to familiarize myself with React's code. I learned to create a build and deploy it on Netlify. Gitrectory will also be deployed on Netlify but this time, as continuous deployment with Git.

## React Things To Keep in Mind

- Use `className` when assigning an attribute to an HTML element in JSX.
- When creating a React app, have a plan in mind to keep track of your several components. It can get confusing!
- Make sure to export the default of your component.
